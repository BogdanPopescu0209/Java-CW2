# Java-CW2

 Task1 - You are required to write a Java 8 program that opens and reads a delimited data file that is located relative
to the NetBeans project root folder. The delimited data file contains information about prize winning music
albums ranked by sales. The data file is called albums.txt. The data file should not be altered and should be
considered as a read-only data file.

Task2 - For this task you are required to write a Java 8 program that incorporates a series of classes that represent
the core logic of an application and provides a NetBeans 8 console user interface. The required Java
application relates to a proposed software system to manage some aspects of charity running events over a
particular year. Below is an initial description of the system domain with a few very simple use cases (i.e.,
just simple, natural language statements).

Task3 - For this task you are required to program a JavaFX Graphical User Interface (GUI), with a focus on layout and
event handling.
